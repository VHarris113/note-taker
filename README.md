## Note-Taker with Express

This is a very useful app to help take notes and keep track of appropriate work or personal related details. This is my first use of express in the back-end field.

## Usage

To begin using the notetaker, please follow the deloyed link in the readme, or click the link on the right hand side of the GitHub. Once on the page, go ahead and the "Get Started" button before continuing in. Once there, you can click to add a note via the pencil on the top right and once you've added your note, the saved icon appears. Click that and you can save your notes. However, if you want to delete them, then click the trash icon at each note title. 

## Thanks
Shout out to the cohort for this out.
